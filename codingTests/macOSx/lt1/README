This directory will hold a simple autool project to 
help understand how libtool on the Mac OS  X works with ranlib.
Particularly, we want to:

1) build a library
2) add to another library
3) link to an executable
4) all while using common global symbols.

gcc -c a.c b.c; rm -rf libab.a a.out; ar -q libab.a a.o b.o; gcc m.c libab.a
